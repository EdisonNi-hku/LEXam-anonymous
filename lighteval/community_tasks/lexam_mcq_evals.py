You are given a multiple-choice question, where only one choice (e.g., A, B, C, etc.) is correct.
Assume Swiss law applies unless specifically stated otherwise. If the context of the course justifies it, consider legal frameworks beyond Swiss law as well.

Please reason through the question step by step, using a chain-of-thought approach:
- Clarify the facts: Briefly restate or highlight the key facts in the question to anchor your reasoning.
- Issue Identification: What legal issue(s) arise from the facts?
- Rule Explanation: What legal rules or principles are relevant, and what are their sources (e.g., statutes, case law, doctrine)?
- Application and Reasoning: Apply the relevant rules to the facts, carefully weighing any ambiguities, exceptions, or competing interpretations.
- Eliminate Incorrect Answers: Briefly explain why each incorrect answer is wrong or less convincing.
- Conclusion: Clearly state the correct answer choice (e.g., A, B, C, etc.) with a brief justification for why it best fits the legal analysis.
